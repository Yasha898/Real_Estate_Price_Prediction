# Real Estate Price Prediction

"Real Estate Price Prediction using Machine Learning" is a project aimed at predicting the prices of real estate properties based on various factors
using machine learning techniques. This project involves collecting and preprocessing real estate data, selecting relevant features, training machine
learning models, and evaluating their performance to predict property prices accurately.

# Key components of the project may include:
1. Data Collection: Gathering data related to real estate properties, including features such as 'Transaction date', 'House age', 
   'Distance to the nearest MRT station','Number of convenience stores', 'Latitude', 'Longitude','House price of unit area'.

2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the collected data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This may involve data
   cleaning, feature engineering, normalization, and scaling to prepare the data for machine learning algorithms.

3. Feature Selection: Selecting the most relevant features or variables that have a significant impact on property prices. Feature selection techniques
    such as correlation analysis, feature importance ranking, and dimensionality reduction may be used to identify the most predictive features.

4. Model Training: Training machine learning models using the preprocessed data to learn the relationships between the selected features and property prices.
   Common regression algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests may be used for price prediction.

5. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE),
    mean absolute error (MAE), or R-squared (R2) to assess how well the models generalize to unseen data.

6. Prediction and Deployment: Making predictions on new or unseen real estate data using the trained machine learning models. Deploying the predictive
    model in a real-world setting to make real-time predictions or integrate it into existing applications.

The goal of the "Real Estate Price Prediction using Machine Learning" project is to develop accurate and reliable models that can predict 
property prices effectively, helping real estate agents, investors, and homeowners make informed decisions about buying, selling, or investing in real estate properties.
